The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Anclora task management application from inception to a feature-rich MVP, replicating Empoche functionalities with a maritime theme. Key development phases included establishing the base structure with user profiles and authentication, implementing core task management (Anclas), and expanding the Puente de Mando dashboard. The engineer meticulously tackled complex features such as Temporal Anchoring (timeline), advanced budget management, web notifications, mobile optimization, and AI-driven financial recommendations. Challenges included integrating diverse features and ensuring robust validation. The engineer consistently followed a structured approach, proposing plans, awaiting user confirmation, and performing backend testing. The final major task was applying a comprehensive style guide, which faced a minor preview error due to a Tailwind CSS configuration issue, successfully resolved by converting the problematic styles to pure CSS. The application is now visually updated and functionally robust across multiple key areas.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to create Anclora, a maritime-themed task management application mirroring Empoche, centered on Temporal Anchoring with visual, draggable anchors for task organization. Key features include a personalized Puente de Mando (dashboard) adaptable to Content Creators, Freelancers, Students, and Professionals, encompassing Gestión de Anclas (categorized tasks), Seguimiento de Hábitos (visual progress), Objetivos del Mes (editable subtasks), Presupuesto (income/expense categories), and Diario (free text, mood, timestamp). It requires comprehensive Ancla creation/editing forms with validation (title, description, type, priority, repetition, scheduling, alerts), a gamification system (Grumete to Capitán progression), an interactive Marea de Tiempo timeline (drag-and-drop), and web notifications. Backend is handled by Supabase (auth, data with RLS), and design demands a mobile-optimized, minimalist, soft pastel interface with specific CSS.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack architecture.



- ****: The main FastAPI application.
  - **Importance**: Contains all backend logic, API endpoints (prefixed with ), and database interaction. It's the core of the server-side functionality.
  - **Changes**: Extensively modified to establish user profiles, dashboard features, task management (Anclas), and new functionalities like advanced budget (models for budgets, savings_goals, financial_reports, and their respective CRUD endpoints), and AI financial recommendations (FinancialAIEngine class and related endpoints). Also includes notification configuration endpoints.
- ****: The main React component.
  - **Importance**: Serves as the application's entry point, handling routing, overall layout, and integrating various sections and components.
  - **Changes**: Updated to integrate profile selection, the Puente de Mando dashboard, routing for Marea de Tiempo (Timeline), Advanced Budget, Notification settings, and AI Financial Assistant. It dynamically renders different dashboards (desktop/mobile).
- ****: Global and utility CSS styles.
  - **Importance**: Defines the base theme, fonts, and general layout. It's central to the application's visual identity.
  - **Changes**: Modified to apply the soft pastel maritime theme, responsive styles, and specific styles for the Timeline, Advanced Budget, Notifications, AI Assistant, and Mobile Dashboard. Recently, it was updated to incorporate styles from , with problematic Tailwind directives removed and converted to pure CSS.
- ****: Houses reusable React components.
  - **Importance**: Critical for organizing UI logic for various dashboard functionalities (Anclas, Hábitos, Objetivos, Presupuesto, Diario), complex Ancla creation/editing forms, and new components like , , , , , , , , , and .
  - **Changes**: This file was continuously expanded with new components for the implemented features.
- ****: Service Worker.
  - **Importance**: Handles web notifications in the background, enabling timely task reminders and alerts.
  - **Changes**: Newly created to implement the web notification system.
- ****: Custom React Hook.
  - **Importance**: Encapsulates the logic for managing and requesting notification permissions.
  - **Changes**: Newly created to support web notifications.
- ****: Design tokens.
  - **Importance**: Centralizes design variables (colors, typography, spacing) for consistent styling as per the Anclora style guide.
  - **Changes**: Newly created as part of applying the style guide.
- ** & **: Environment variables.
  - **Importance**: Store configuration like  and , preventing hardcoding and managing sensitive information.
  - **Changes**: No direct modifications, but critical for application setup.
- ** & **: Dependency management files.
  - **Importance**: Ensure all necessary Python and Node.js libraries are correctly defined and installed.
  - **Changes**: Updated periodically to include new dependencies (e.g., Chart.js for frontend).
- ****: Testing protocol and results.
  - **Importance**: Contains testing instructions, user problem statements, and logs of backend/frontend test summaries. It's crucial for understanding test outcomes and guiding further development.
  - **Changes**: Regularly updated with test summaries and feature completion status.
- ****: Design style guide.
  - **Importance**: Provides comprehensive design guidelines for the Anclora application, covering branding, color palette, typography, spacing, iconography, UI components, accessibility, and more.
  - **Changes**: This file was provided by the user and read by the AI engineer to apply visual changes across the application.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit functionalities from the initial  section (, , , ) have been implemented or partially addressed. The Analítica visual was heavily covered by the advanced budget features, and Integraciones adicionales are not explicitly requested beyond the current scope. There are no remaining explicitly *pending* tasks from the original list that haven't been touched.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed applying the comprehensive Anclora Style Guide to the entire application. This involved updating CSS with design tokens, typography, button styles, card/form styles, dashboard navigation, and responsive elements. A  file was created for centralized design variables.

Immediately prior to this summary, an error was encountered during preview due to the use of  without proper Tailwind CSS configuration. The AI engineer resolved this by removing the  directive from  and converting the affected styles to pure CSS, ensuring all official Anclora CSS variables are maintained. The  component was also updated to align with the new styling approach, specifically for  class with  and  to apply the grid system.

The product's current state is visually updated according to the , with a professional, nautical, and modern design. All previously implemented features—including the interactive Marea de Tiempo timeline, the comprehensive Presupuesto Incrementado with advanced analytics and graphs, the full web notification system (Service Worker, custom hook, settings, toasts), and the AI-driven financial recommendations—are integrated and reported as fully functional after extensive backend and frontend testing. Mobile optimization has also been completed and verified.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to ask the user to re-preview the application to confirm the style guide application and the resolution of the preview error.
